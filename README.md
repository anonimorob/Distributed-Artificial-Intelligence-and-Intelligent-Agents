Project1

The first assignment focuses on the introduction to the GAMA platform and implementing a simple simulation for you to get familiar with the environment and agents.

In short, create a project that simulates a festival where Guests (Agents) get hungry or thirsty. If they do, they should go to an Information Center (Agent) to ask for the nearest Store (Agent) that gives them what they need. Afterward, the Guests should simply keep doing something until they get hungry/thirsty again.
