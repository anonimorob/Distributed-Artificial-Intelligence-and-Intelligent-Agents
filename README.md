This repository contains three assignments that explore agent-based systems using the GAMA platform and FIPA communication protocols.

Project 1: GAMA and Agent-Based Simulation
This project introduces the GAMA platform for agent-based simulations. The task involves creating a festival simulation where Guests (Agents) experience hunger or thirst. When this occurs, they visit an Information Center (Agent) to inquire about the nearest Store (Agent) that provides food or drinks. Once satisfied, the Guests resume their activities until they become hungry or thirsty again.

Project 2: Negotiation and Communication (FIPA)
In this assignment, FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) communication protocols are implemented to simulate a Dutch auction. A new Auctioneer (Agent) is introduced at the festival to sell products. The Auctioneer communicates with Guests using FIPA protocols, gradually lowering the price until a buyer is found or the auction is terminated.

Project 3: Coordination and Utility
This project focuses on agent coordination. In a variation of the classic N-Queens problem, Queens (Agents) are only allowed to communicate with their immediate predecessor and successor. The goal is to achieve coordinated decision-making under these constraints.
