Project1

The first assignment focuses on the introduction to the GAMA platform and implementing a simple simulation for you to get familiar with the environment and agents.

In short, create a project that simulates a festival where Guests (Agents) get hungry or thirsty. If they do, they should go to an Information Center (Agent) to ask for the nearest Store (Agent) that gives them what they need. Afterward, the Guests should simply keep doing something until they get hungry/thirsty again.

Project 2 

The second assignment focuses on adding a second skill to an Agent, called FIPA for agent-based communication protocol to participate in auctions.
 
In short, add an Auctioneer (new Agent) that tries to sell a product at the festival using the FIPA communication skills. The Guests should communicate back using FIPA. The interaction should be based on the Dutch auction (can be found in slides) where the Auctioneer starts at a high price and reduces it in every round if no one is willing to buy it. If the price reaches a bare minimum price, the auction is terminated.
